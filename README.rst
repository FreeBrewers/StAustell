Method
======

Mill malt to course grist.

Mash with liquor at single temperature (65 degrees C) for 90 minutes.
(Liquor ratio, 2.5 parts liquor to 1 part grist)

Set taps and sparge mash at 74 C. Run worts to brewing copper; collect 35 barrels (5700 litres) at 53 gravity.

Add Northern Brewer hops and boil for 60 mins.

Add Willamette hops and 150 grams ‘Copper’ finings. Boil for a further 15 mins. Simultaneously infuse milled Gurana in hot liquor at 74 C for 15 mins.

Add guarana infusion to copper and cast wort into hopback.

Recirculate worts to hopback for ten minutes or until worts bright, and the forward to wort receiver. Then cool through paraflow to 14.5 C and collect in fermenter. Add dissolved oxygen at paraflow to 15 ppm.

Adjust gravity to 56 degrees OG (14 Plato) and pitch with ale yeast (we use St Austell own strain, but may be replaced by any top fermenting ale strain, e.g. Whitbread B, or Nottingham Ale)

Hold at maximum temperature of 15 C for 44 hours and then allow to ramp to 18 C for a further 24 hours. Skim yeast and allow 24-hour stand at 18 C to reduce diacetyl. Cool back to 8 C over 48 hours.

Total fermentation time is 7 days. Beer is then racked to conditioning tank, where it is crash chilled to 0 C, and held at this temperature for 7 days. The beer is then sterile (0.45 micron) filtered and dosed with 1 degree of glucose syrup and reseeded with 0.25 million cells per ml ale yeast and bottled.

Bottled beer requires two to three weeks in bottle top ‘condition’ before it is ready for drinking.
